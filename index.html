        <h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>MM Curses is a project aiming at bringing a full movie manager to the CLI, usable entirely without X.
It is targeted at GUI-haters, Curses-lovers or just movie-lovers who want to try a new way to enjoy their favorite films.
It uses mplayer as a backend by default, but you will be able to personalize it as much as you want in the future!</p>
